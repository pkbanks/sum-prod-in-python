# Code Challenge:
# Given a list of integers and a target integer, return a numpy array of 1 or 0 values, such that the sumproduct of the list and corresponding array returns the target integer.  In the case of ties, return the numpy array with the fewest non-zero elements.

# For example:
# If choices = [1,2,2,3] and total = 4 you should return either [0 1 1 0] or [1 0 0 1]
# If choices = [1,1,3,5,3] and total = 5 you should return [0 0 0 1 0]
# If choices = [1,1,1,9] and total = 4 you should return [1 1 1 0]
